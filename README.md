# roll_dice_app_on_Flutter-Dart
It is the project which is a part of the udemy course "Flutter & Dart - The Complete Guide [2024 Edition]" by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.

Do not forget that you need to install flutter SDKs, an IDE (i used VsCode) and a real or virtual android device (i used AVD from Android Studio) on your computer to run these Dart files. If you need to ask me about this app or anything, do not shy away from me. You can contact me via LinkedIn.
